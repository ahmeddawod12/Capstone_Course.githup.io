# Projects will be found here:

## 1) Linear Regression Project.ipynb
 
This is part of capstone_project for Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp especially Machine Learning section.

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use ML in analyzing the data.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to understand two answer two questions:

1) How to apply ML model specially Linear Regression model to understand data's relations?

2) Which is the most area for the company to focus on mobile app or website to publish their products?

## 2) Logistic Regression Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use ML in analyzing the data but in this time for categorical items (0,1).

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the '***Clicked on Ad***' in the upcoming periods with 90% confidence interval.

## 3) K Nearest Neighbors Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm as It classifies a data point based on how similar its neighbors are. For example, if you want to classify a data point, the algorithm looks at its closest neighbors (based on distance, like Euclidean distance) and assigns the **majority** class among those neighbors.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the '***TARGET CLASS***' in the upcoming periods with 85% accuarcy using _k = 85_.
