# Projects will be found here:

## 1) Linear Regression Project.ipynb
 
This is part of capstone_project for Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp especially Machine Learning section.

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use ML in analyzing the data.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to understand two answer two questions:

1) How to apply ML model specially Linear Regression model to understand data's relations?

2) Which is the most area for the company to focus on mobile app or website to publish their products?

## 2) Logistic Regression Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use ML in analyzing the data but in this time for categorical items (0,1).

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the '***Clicked on Ad***' in the upcoming periods with 90% confidence interval.

## 3) K Nearest Neighbors Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm as It classifies a data point based on how similar its neighbors are. For example, if you want to classify a data point, the algorithm looks at its closest neighbors (based on distance, like Euclidean distance) and assigns the **majority** class among those neighbors.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the '***TARGET CLASS***' in the upcoming periods with 85% accuarcy using _k = 85_.

## 4) Decision Trees and Random Forest Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use Random Forest Project as it builds an ensemble of multiple decision trees. By averaging their predictions, Random Forests reduce overfitting and improve model stability.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the '***not.fully.paid***' in the upcoming periods.

## 5)Support Vector Machines Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use Support Vector Machines(SVC) as It can find the best way to draw a line (or a boundary) that separates your data which it can use that line to decide which category new data points belong to.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to predict the in the upcoming periods '***species categories***' will belong to which (setosa, versicolor or virginica).

## 6) K Means Clustering Project.ipynb

**The aim** for the project to highlight my new skills in learning how to use K Means Clustering as It organizes the all mixed categories into groups where the items in each group are similar to each other.

**The subject** for this project to analyze and try to organize the '***Private Column***' to which group it belongs to.
